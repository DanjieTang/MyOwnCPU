## Program Description
This program can be conceptualized as a video game, wherein the user is required to hold onto a switch in order to charge up energy that enables the program to jump to a higher location on the HEX display. As with typical video games, the initial charging of energy is rapid, but with the progression of time, the charging speed slows down. The length of time the switch is held down determines the amount of energy stored, which is visually represented using LEDs. Upon releasing the switch, the program will advance a red line by a number of steps proportional to the amount of energy stored. Once the end of the line is reached, the program will display the word "PASSED" on the HEX display, signifying successful completion of the task.
